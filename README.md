# RockPaperScissors
A program that runs a head-to-head Rock Paper Scissors tournament between bots. The application runs in the browser.

Add bots to the bots folder, and include them in index.html.

Bots take in two arrays, all their plays in a given head-to-head, and all the opponent's plays.

Bot output should be an integer 1, 2, or 3 (for Rock, Paper, or Scissors respectively).
